# bluez-hid2hci
For laptops to recognize the bluetooth device in Void Linux.

For Void Linux

Bluez's dirvers itself wasn't enough for my laptop to recognize the bluetooth device. I discovered that I missed the "bluez-hid2hci" drivers 
that is not available on Void Linux repositories. My source packages are Cent-OS and Fedora's "rpm" packages from their repositories. Firstly 
I converted them to "deb" packages via "alien" in DebianOS; then to "xbps" via the "xdeb" app.

Both of them working on my laptop. You can use either one.
